# Crypto RSI Trading Bot

## üìå Overview
This bot uses the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** strategy to trade **BTC/USDT** on the **Binance** exchange via the **ccxt** library.  
It automatically buys or sells based on RSI signals and predefined profit/loss conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Connect to Binance** using your API keys via the `ccxt` library.
2. **Fetch market data**: downloads the last 100 candles of 15-minute BTC/USDT price data.
3. **Calculate RSI** using the `ta` technical analysis library.
4. **Trading Logic**:
   - **Buy Signal**:  
     - If RSI < 30  
     - And no current open position  
     - ‚Üí Buys BTC worth 1% of current USDT balance.
   - **Sell Signals** (if a position is open):  
     - Price drops 2% below entry ‚Üí Sell (stop loss)  
     - Price rises 4% above entry ‚Üí Sell (take profit)  
     - RSI > 70 ‚Üí Sell (overbought condition)
5. **Profit & Loss Tracking**: Each sell logs the profit/loss and adds it to your running `pnl`.
